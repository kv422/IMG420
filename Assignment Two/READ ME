This game is similar to game one, where you have to avoid the evil kitties. 

However, in this version you need to also avoid the bottom of the screen, that is where the evil crab kitty lives.

* Note I was not able to connect the EvilCrab node to the main, however there is functionality with the evil crab, it just does not collide with the character.
